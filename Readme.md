## CLC -- Cloud Computing

This repository covers a number of toy projects in the 2017 Cloud-computing class 
given by Prof. Jordi Torres, Dept of architecture of Computers, Faculty of 
Computer Science of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain. 
Some of the Lab material and reported solutions is appropriate for teaching a 
gentle introduction to cloud-based and to distributed computing (at Master level).

##### Content:
Some of the work presented here is concerned with toy examples designed so that 
students may hone their skills, adhering to a very hands-on approach. (Prof. 
Torres is a staunch advocate of learning by practicing.)
This repo contains Labs , each to a folder (Lab1, Lab2, etc). 

##### Data-sets:
Some of the used dataset were not uploaded on this repo. This is due to either 
the size limitation on individual files imposed by GitHub or to the fact that 
although the data is freely available you may only obtain it from its owner / 
maintainer. A good example of that is Tweeter data.  In cases where the data is 
not included at least a snapshot of the datasets is provided as well as a URL, 
where it or similar data can be downloaded.  The newly obtained dataset may or 
may not be identical to the one originally used to obtain results presented here. 
The responsability for that falls squarely on the data maintainer. In practice 
however, interested people may still benefit from the strategy laid out to deal 
with the data, irrespectively of whether some  or all of the data has changed. 
Dataset changes over the years are likely to be all or nothing in any case; i.e. 
a dataset may cease to be available because the website has disappeared, moved 
or its EULA changed. In such a case you will be left with the code (the cutlery)
and it filling your plate with suitable food (pertinent data) will be your very first step.
