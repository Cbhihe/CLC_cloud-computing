# CLC -- Cloud Computing

”Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.”
 -Benjamin Franklin



This repository covers a number of toy projects in the 2017 Cloud-computing 
class given by Prof. Jordi Torres, Dept of architecture of Computers, Faculty of 
Computer Science of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain. 
Some of the Lab material and reported solutions is appropriate for teaching a 
gentle introduction to cloud-based and to distributed computing (at Master level).

##### Content:
Some of the work presented here is concerned with toy examples designed so that 
students may hone their skills, adhering to a very hands-on approach. (Prof. 
Torres is a staunch advocate of learning by practicing.)
This repo contains 5 lab assignments, one to a folder (Lab1, Lab2, etc). 

##### Data-sets:
Some of the used dataset were not uploaded on this repo. This is due to either 
the size limitation on individual files imposed by GitHub or to the fact that 
although the data is freely available you may only obtain it from its owner / 
maintainer. A good example of that is Tweeter data.  In cases where the data is 
not included at least a snapshot of the datasets is provided as well as a URL, 
where it or similar data can be downloaded.  The newly obtained dataset may or 
may not be identical to the one originally used to obtain results presented here. The responsability for that falls squarely on the data maintainer. In 
practice however, interested people may still benefit from the strategy laid out 
to deal with the data, irrespectively of whether some  or all of the data has 
changed. Dataset changes over the years are likely to be all or nothing in any 
case; i.e. a dataset may cease to be available because the website has 
disappeared, moved or its EULA changed. In such a case you will be left with the 
code (the cutlery) and it filling your plate with suitable food (pertinent data) 
will be your very first step.

## Practical assignments

There will be two kinds of assignments: 5 Labs and one project. Pre-lab homework will be assigned for some labs. Students are expected to complete and submit the assigned pre-lab homework before each lab session.

### Labs
Their objective is to equip the student with a basic toolbox to get started in the Cloud. This includes understanding several APIs, as as many gateways to the Cloud. This will allow the students to mine data coming from the Cloud, or use new advanced analytics services provided in the Cloud. Finally, we will look under the hood of these advanced analytics services in the Cloud, either in terms of software or hardware, in order to understand how their high performance requirements can be provided. The purpose is to provide code examples that can get you started easily.

- Lab 1: (Basic "Knowledge Toolbox" to getting started in the Cloud)[https://github.com/jorditorresBCN/Assignments/blob/master/Lab01.md] 10%
- Lab 2: (Doors in the Cloud)[https://github.com/jorditorresBCN/Assignments/blob/master/Lab02.md]                                        20%
- Lab 3: (Extracting and Analyzing data from the Cloud)[https://github.com/jorditorresBCN/Assignments/blob/master/Lab03.md]              20%
- Lab 4: (Interacting with users and services in the Cloud)[https://github.com/jorditorresBCN/Assignments/blob/master/Lab04.md]          20% + 5% opt 
- Lab 5: (Under the hood of Cloud Advanced Analytics Services)[https://github.com/jorditorresBCN/Assignments/blob/master/Lab05.md]       20% + 5% opt

### Course Project
Projects will be conducted in groups of 1, 2 or 3 students.  They require pre-approval by your teaching staff. For that students need to submit a proposal which may give rise to a short interview with their teaching staff in case of need.

**Six levels:** 
***Minimum*** (max  grade obtained 60%): One possibility of project is to prepare a presentation of some related technologies with this part of the course (with slides).

***Medium*** (max grade obtained 90%): Another alternative to the project may be to create a self-contained practical guide (hands-on) that guides the reader in learning one of the latest cloud technologies.

***Full*** (option 1): The standard project is to create an application using existing APIs. Start here for [more information](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/02/6-deep-learning-applications-beginner-python/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AnalyticsVidhya+%28Analytics+Vidhya%29).<BR>
For example:<BR>
- Colorize photos using Deep Learning  with Algorithmia API
- Build a ChatBot with Watson API
- Build a news aggregator based on Sentiment with Aylien API
  
* **Full (option 2)**:  Carry out one of the projects suggested by the professor during this course.

***Advanced option 1*** (bonus of +10%):  The project offers an excellent opportunity for the student to dive into course content by implementing a protoype (proof of concept implementation of a business idea created by the student) using the latest Cloud technology. Your teacher will be deligted to help you

***Advanced option 2*** (bonus of +10%):  Surprise your teaching staff with a project proposal they accept.

### Deadlines
#### Deadlines for Labs
The deadlines indicated are suggestions for when you should ideally finish each Hands-on. They are meant to help keep you on track so that you maintain an appropriate pace throughout the program. There are penalties if you miss these deadlines. It is a recommended best practice to try and meet each suggested deadline.
#### Deadline for course Project
The deadlines indicated in the course syllabus is a hard deadline.
