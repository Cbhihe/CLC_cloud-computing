## clc -- Cloud Computing

This repository recoups a number of toy projects in cloud-computing. Some of the content is appropriate for teaching Master level classes in CS.

##### Content:
Some of the work presented here is concerned with mere toy examples meant for others to hone their skills. They are mostly those in folders named Lab1, Lab2, etc.  Other developments are more personal and involve a greater amount of scripting/coding using various shells, java, javascript, python and possibly more.

##### Data-sets:
Some of the data set used were not uploaded on this repo due to either the size limitation on individual files imposed by GitHub or to the fact that although the data is freely available it can only be obtained from its maintainer. A good example of that is tweeter. In such cases at least a snapshot of the data sets is provided as well as a URL, where it or similar data can be downloaded. The thus newly obtained data set may or may not be identical to the one originally used to obtain results presented here. The responsability for that falls squarely on the data maintainer. In practice however, interested people may still benefit from the strategy laid out to deal with the data, irrespectively of whether some of the data as changed. Data set changes over the years (if any) are likely to be all or nothing in any case; i.e. a data set may cease to be available because the website has disappeared, moved or its EULA changed... 

##### Licensing terms and copyright:
Feel free to copy any material found here and to further release it to the general public, subject to the terms of the GNU General Public License v3... That license is not a right granted to you to plagiarize the content of the repo. Your publisher, your editor, your university, your mother and common decency all have rules against that.  So use common sense and live happily ever after.

TLDR: *Basically the material on this repo is available for free (as in "free beer") as long as you always attach its authors' names to it, along with the above mentioned license's terms. You should also not include it in other work, program, product or applications (commercial in nature or not) which do not comply with the GNU General Public License v3 or with something "very very close".*  
Of course the above one sentence summary cannot be considered authoritative in terms of licensing.  It does not replace the GNU General Public License v3 included in this repo, which recoups the complete licensing terms for your reading pleasure. ;-)

The repo material copyright however stays with me and with any contributors to this repo, according to who contributed what to the contents of the repo.
