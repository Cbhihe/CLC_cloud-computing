The following comments were made by Cedric Bhihe: 
  - I spent an enormous amount of time doing completing this lab, over 11 hours in total.

  - The assignment text should specify very clearly that installation of anaconda3 instead of anaconda2 will lead to endless and tedious corrective measures for the student.
 
  - Basically this has been an enormous waste of time for me, mainly because of that problem due to a bad installation choice at the very beginning.
