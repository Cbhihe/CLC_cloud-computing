The following comments were made by **Cedric Bhihe**: 
   - Interesting set of exercises. Thank you.
   - In the end we did not complete the extended character set tokenization routine to include asian 
   characters and diacriticals because of the time involved. The issue is difficult because of the lack 
   of default native support for utf-8 encoding by Python 2 or 3. We do believe that developing the 
   appropriate routine to correctly tokenize any character set is possible though.
